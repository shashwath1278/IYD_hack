Verse: 3

Ravana killed Seetha in front of us, even though she continued to weep."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 9

to report the event to you."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 10
Content: Hearing those words of Hanuma, Rama then was agitated with grief and fell down on
the ground, like a tree with its bottom chopped off.
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 11
Content: On seeing that Rama, who with the semblance of god, falling on the ground, the
chiefs of monkeys came bouncing from all sides and rushed towards him.
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 12
Content: They sprinkled him with water, fragrant with scent of lotuses and lilies, as one
would sprinkle an inextinguishable as one would sprinkle an inextinguishable fire, which has just
flared up suddenly and is burning all.
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 13
Content: Then, the highly lamenting Lakshmana, having embraced that ailing Rama in his arms,
spoke the following meaningful words, endowed with reason:
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 14
Content: "O venerable brother! Virtue cannot save you, who are sticking to the noble path and
who have subdued the senses, from adversities and is (hence) useless."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 15
Content: "Just as inanimate and animate beings are visible, likewise virtue and vice are not
visible. Therefore, my opinion is that virtue is non-existent."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 16
Content: "Even as inanimate beings and animate beings are expressly visible, likewise this
form of virtue of vice is not established. For, in that case, a virtuous man like you would not
have this misfortune."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 17
Content: "If unrighteousness had been effective, Ravana should have obtained the hell. You,
endowed with virtue, would never obtain such troubles."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 18
Content: "Since there is absence of calamity for Ravana and misfortune occurred to you, the
result of vice is obtained through virtue and the result of virtue is obtained through vice. The
contraries of each other have changed the roles with each other."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 19
Content: Will the fruit of virtue be obtained through virtue and fruit of vice through vice?
If that in whom unrighteousness is rooted are enjoined with the fruit of unrighteousness alone,
people showing interest in unrighteousness would be deprived of the fruit of virtue. The fruit of
virtue alone would have accrued to those who administer righteousness through that virtue?
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 21
Content: Since prosperities of those, in whom unrighteousness is rooted, develop; while those
who have a conduct of virtue suffer, hence these two (virtue and vice) are useless.
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 22
Content: "O Rama! If sinful doers are killed by their own vice, that unrighteousness, as it
does, in the act of killing, will be forthwith destroyed. Whom will that unrighteousness destroy
(which is destroyed in the course of three seconds)?"
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 23
Content: "Or if a man is killed by a recourse to a ritual prescribed in the scriptures or
kills another (by recourse to such a ritual), that destiny alone, which is engendered by that
ritual, is tainted by that sinful act and not the agent."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 24
Content: "O Rama, the destroyer of adversaries! It is not clear how prosperity can be reached
by righteousness, which has never known how to retaliate. Hence, righteousness seems to be
non-existent."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 25
Content: "O chief among the virtuous! If righteousness were really there, no evil whatever
would have accrued to you. As you reaped such a calamity, the hypotheses that the destiny
engendered by virtuous acts is real is not proved."*
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 26
Content: "Or else, if righteousness becomes weak and cowardly, as it surrenders to the might,
it is my opinion that the righteousness, which lacks strength and has been deprived of its
capacity, should no longer be pursued."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 27
Content: "Depend on might, as you do now on virtue, if the virtue is subordinate to might,
thus giving up predominance of virtue."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 28
Content: "O tormentator of enemies! Or else, if speaking truth were indeed a virtue, our
lying father, who was merciless to you, was disunited from you. Were you not bound by that
announcement made by our father regarding your installation as the Prince Regent?"
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 29
Content: "O tormentator of your enemies! Had either righteousness or unrighteousness worth
pursuing, Indra the wielder of thunderbolt would not have performed a sacrifice on killing a sage
(viz. Viswarupa, son of Twasta*)
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 30
Content: "O Rama! Virtue destroys enemies, when united with might (something other than
virtue). O Rama! A man does all this, according to his will."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 31
Content: "O Rama in a pitiable condition. My opinion is that righteousness consists in such
recourse to both virtue and strength. The very roots of virtue (in the form of earthly gain) have
been chopped off by you in that you spurned the sovereignty the other day."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 32
Content: "By the treasures brought from place to place and augmented by means of various
strategies, all the tasks are indeed fulfilled, as the rivers flow from the mountains."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 33
Content: "All the tasks of a man of small intellect, bereft of his wealth, get a cessation as
small rivers dry up in summer-season."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 34
Content: "Such a man, brought up by comforts, renouncing wealth (within easy reach) and
seeking comfort, proceeds to commit sinful act and then evil (in the form of punishment) follows
from it."

Verse: 35
Content: "Friends gather round him, who has riches. Relatives stand by him, who has riches.
He alone is virile in the world, who has riches. He alone is a learned man, who has riches."

Chapter: 83
Verse: 36
Content: "He alone is a mighty man, who has riches. He alone is a prudent man, who has
riches. He alone is highly fortunate. He alone is distinguished, who has riches."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 37
Content: "O resolute one! I told you about these evils attendant on the abjuration of wealth.
The ground on which you made the resolve to sacrifice the kingdom was not known to me."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 38
Content: "A man in whom the treasures abide, religious merit and wealth are obtained. All
would be favourable to him. To the penniless man, who has a desire for wealth and even hunting for
wealth, it is not possible to attain wealth."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 39
Content: "O king! Delight, sensuous pleasure, pride, virtue, anger, peace, control of the
senses all these are attained from wealth."
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 83
Verse: 40

Verse: 44
Content: "O faultless one! On seeing the death of Seetha and enraged, rising to do favour for
you, I shall completely destroy with my arrows, Lanka with its chariots, elephants and horses along

Verse: 15
Content: "Certainly, this conjuring trick (in the form of killing an illusory living effigy

Chapter: 84
Verse: 16
Content: "While the sacrificial performance is not ended, we shall proceed to that place,
along with an army. O the foremost of men! Give up this improper grief, which has come upon you.

----------------------------------------

Chapter: 84
Verse: 23
Content: "If that Indrajit, the foremost of demons completes the sacrifice, he would not be
visible even to the celestials and the demons in battle. If he come with a desire to fight, after
